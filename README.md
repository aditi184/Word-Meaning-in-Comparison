# Word Meaning Comparison

Words often have multiple meanings associated with them and the surrounding context often determines the specific meaning of the word which is used. 

For example, consider the following sentences (S1, S2, S3)

1. We often used to play on the <u>bank</u> of the river 
2. We lived along the <u>bank</u> of the Ganges. 
3. He cashed a check at the <u>bank</u> 

S1 and S2 use the same meaning of the word bank (river bed) while S1 and S3 use different meanings of the word bank (river bed vs. financial institution).

In this work we develop deep neural networks to solve this classification problem ie whether a word has same or different meaning in different sentences. This is part of [Natural Language Processing](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/courses/col772/autumn2021/) course taken by [Prof Mausam](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/).
